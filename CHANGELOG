### Upgrade Notes

#### 1. InvoiceCollection

When creating invoices or using `mark_failed()`, we now return an `InvoiceCollection` object rather than an `Invoice`. If you wish to upgrade your application without changing functionality, we recommend that you use the `charge_invoice` on the `InvoiceCollection`. Example:

```python
# Change This:
invoice = account.invoice()

# To this
collection = account.invoice()
invoice = collection.charge_invoice
```

Calls that now return `InvoiceCollection` instead of `Invoice`:

* `Purchase#invoice()`
* `Purchase#preview()`
* `Purchase#authorize()`
* `Account#invoice()`
* `Account#build_invoice()`

Furthermore, `Invoice#mark_failed()` no longer updates the invoice but rather returns a new `InvoiceCollection` object:

```python
# Change This:
invoice.mark_failed()

# To this
collection = invoice.mark_failed()
failed_invoice = collection.charge_invoice
```

#### 2. Invoice#original_invoice removed

`Invoice#original_invoice` was removed in favor of `Invoice#original_invoices`. If you want to maintain functionality, change your code grab the first invoice from that endpoint:

```python
# Change this
original_invoice = invoice.original_invoice()

# To this
original_invoice = invoice.original_invoices()[0]
```

#### 3. Invoice `subtotal_*` changes

We have renamed two of the invoice subtotal fields to more clearly reflect their values: 
- Renamed `subtotal_in_cents` to `subtotal_before_discount_in_cents`
- Renamed `subtotal_after_discount_in_cents` to `subtotal_in_cents`

#### 4. Invoice Refund -- `refund_apply_order` changed to `refund_method`

If you were using `Invoice#refund` or `Invoice#refund_amount` and explicitly setting the second `refund_apply_order` parameter, then you may need to change value to fit the new `refund_method` format. The values for this have changed from (`credit`, `transaction`) to (`credit_first`, `transaction_first`)

If you don't explicitly set the `refund_apply_order` like in these two calls, no change is needed:
```python
invoice.refund(line_items);
invoice.refund_amount(1000);
```

If you do set the second param, you'll need to change:
* `credit` to `credit_first`
* `transaction` to `transaction_first`

Examples:
```python
# Change `credit`:
invoice.refund(line_items, 'credit');
invoice.refund_amount(1000, 'credit');

# To `credit_first`
invoice.refund(line_items, 'credit_first');
invoice.refund_amount(1000, 'credit_first');

# Change `transaction`
invoice.refund(line_items, 'transaction');
invoice.refund_amount(1000, 'transaction');

# To `transaction_first`
invoice.refund(line_items, 'transaction_first');
invoice.refund_amount(1000, 'transaction_first');
```

#### 5. Invoice States

If you are checking `Invoice#state` anywhere, you will want to check that you have the new correct values. `collected` has changed to `paid` and `open` has changed to `pending`. Example:

```python
# Change this
if invoice.state == 'collected':
#To this
if invoice.state == 'paid':
```
```python
# Change this
if invoice.state == 'open':
# To this
if invoice.state == 'pending':
```

This also affects the `Invoice.all_collected` and `Invoice.all_open` functions. Example:

```python
# Change this
Invoice.all_collected()
# To this
Invoice.all_paid()
```
```python
# Change this
Invoice.all_open()
# To this
Invoice.all_pending()
```

#
## Version 2.7.0 – November 20, 2017 ##

- Implement API version 2.9 changes

### Upgrade Notes

This version bumps us to API version 2.9. There are a few breaking changes.

1. The `subscription` link on an instance of `Adjustment` is now only created if adjustment is
originating from a subscription plan charge, setup fee, add on, trial or proration credit.
It is no longer created for other adjustments.

2. Instances of `Transaction` and `Invoice` no longer have a `subscription` link and you
must now use the `subscriptions` link.

## Version 2.6.2 – November 9, 2017 ##

- Fix SSRF vuln in Resource.get

## Version 2.6.1 October 26, 2017

- Added missing attributes on Delivery resource

## Version 2.6.0 October 12, 2017

This brings us to API version 2.8.

- imported_trial flag on Subscription
- Purchases endpoint
- Support multiple suberrors per field in ValidationError

### Upgrade Notes

There are two breaking changes in this API version you must consider. 

#### Country Codes

All `country` fields must now contain valid [2 letter ISO 3166 country codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html). If your country code fails validation, you will receive a validation error. This affects any endpoint where an address is collected.

#### Purchase Currency

The purchases endpoint can create and invoice multiple adjustments at once but our invoices can only contain items in one currency. To make this explicit the currency can no longer be provided on an adjustment, it must be set once for the entire purchase:

```python
purchase = recurly.Purchase(
  # The purchase object is the only place you can set the currency:
  currency = 'USD',
  account = recurly.Account(
    account_code = 'someone',
  ),
  adjustments = [
      # Remove this currency
      # You can no longer set the currency on adjustment level
      recurly.Adjustment(currency='USD', unit_amount_in_cents=1000, description='Item 1',
                         quantity=1),
  ]
)
```

## Version 2.5.1 – November 9, 2017 ##

- Fix SSRF vuln in Resource.get

## Version 2.5.0 April 17, 2017

- Remove parsing of X-Records header
- Cardless Free Trial changes for 2.6

### Upgrade Notes

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.6. There are two breaking changes:

1. Since the X-Records header was removed in the pagination endpoint, you can no longer call `len()` on a Page and expect it to return a cached response.
From now on you need to explicitly call the `count()` class method on a Page. See [PR #202](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-python/pull/202) for more information.
2. For `POST /v2/subscriptions` Sending `None` for `total_billing_cycles` attribute will now override plan `total_billing_cycles` setting and will make subscription renew forever.
Omitting the attribute will cause the setting to default to the value of plan `total_billing_cycles`.
